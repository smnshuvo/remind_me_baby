## About this app

This project is my first flutter App.
In this pandemic situation of COVID'19, we are having online classes. This is an obvious good step. But things are changed. I already have an app named ```25thSWEAiO``` which is unfortunately closed sources as I have decided it to be.
Also that project was developed using Native Android Code, Java to be exact. 

The limitation with that app is:
- The period bars are fixed (As classes were always in fixed time, and I never thought that schedule will break)
like ```8.30 - 10.00 [SE123 - Room : XX - TI: ABC]```,every value was changable there, just not the time.
- There was no option to create an alarm as it wasn't needed then. We were all active at that time.

I could have updated the exisiting app, but I didn't. 
üòë Because I am learning flutter.
